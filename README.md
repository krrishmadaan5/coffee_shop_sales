# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis – Power BI Project

This project explores and analyzes over **150,000+ transactions** from a New York-based coffee chain. Using **Power BI**, I built an interactive dashboard that identifies sales trends, product performance, store insights, and improvement areas.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Weekends contribute only **27% of total sales** – potential for targeted promotions.
- Peak hours are **9 AM to 11 AM** – ideal for upselling strategies.
- High growth in product categories like **Tea**, **Drinking Chocolate**, and **Coffee Beans**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
